Title: Canonical Correlations and Tests of Independence
Description: A simple interface for multivariate correlation analysis that unifies various classical
  statistical procedures including t-tests, tests in univariate and multivariate linear models,
  parametric and nonparametric tests for correlation, Kruskal-Wallis tests, standard non-exact
  versions of Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed rank tests, chi-squared tests of independence, score
  tests of particular hypotheses in generalized linear models, canonical correlation analysis and
  linear discriminant analysis.
